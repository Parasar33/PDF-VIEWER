# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Based PDF Reader

## Overview
The **RAG-based PDF Reader** is a Java-based PDF viewer integrated with Python for advanced document processing. This project combines the power of **Java Swing** for user-friendly interface design and **Python** for efficient PDF content extraction and AI-powered text retrieval using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## Key Features
- **PDF Viewing**: A fully functional PDF viewer built using Java Swing for smooth user interaction.
- **AI-powered Summarization**: Integrates Python for content extraction and text summarization based on user queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Future integration of RAG for enhanced document comprehension and information retrieval from PDFs.
- **Cross-language Integration**: Python modules seamlessly integrated with the Java Swing frontend.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Swing**: For building the PDF viewer interface.
- **Python**: For document parsing, extraction, and future AI integration.
- **PDFBox**: To handle PDF rendering and processing.
- **Llama 3**: For future AI-powered text retrieval and summarization.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Planned for enhanced document understanding.

## Current Status
- **Java Swing interface**: Fully functional and capable of displaying PDF documents.
- **Python integration**: Basic PDF processing setup for text extraction.
- **RAG Implementation**: Future step for using an LLM for document summarization and content retrieval.

## Download
To get started, download the latest **JAR file** from the [releases section](https://github.com/Parasar33/PDF-VIEWER/releases). Simply download the JAR, and you can run the PDF reader directly on your system.

## Future Work
- **RAG Integration**: Implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to allow the PDF reader to summarize and retrieve relevant content based on user queries.
- **Enhanced AI Features**: Introduce more AI features for document comprehension and natural language processing.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improve the efficiency of document parsing and retrieval processes.
